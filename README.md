#### aixnr/bookmarks

Here are some interesting facts about me

1. I read a lot. The bookmark bar on my Google Chrome is basically a library of reading list. The sources of the materials come from multiple places, usually Reddit, HackerNews, Twitter, email subscriptions of InstaPaper and Medium, et cetera.

2. Previously, I put all the bookmarks at [NightlyLibrary](https://nightlylibrary.wordpress.com/). I love using GitHub and Markdown (I feel a little bit more geekier), hence I decided to use GitHub as the repository of my reading list.

3. There is no specific date in which I update the list. I will update this reading list when there are a lot of bookmarks on my Google Chrome.

4. Have fun digging!
